# fileServer
Adobe homework project

the purpose to do file system operations using web interface.

In order to start this you need to open the project with your IDE (I used Intellij to develop)
Right now 4 HTTP methods are implemented: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
GET:
POST:
PUT:
DELETE:

to run:
in the root directory: mvn clean install
java -cp target/fileserver-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar Main <port> <serverhome>
ex: java -cp target/fileserver-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar Main 5000 C:\Users\ccostea\Desktop\fileServer-master\target
